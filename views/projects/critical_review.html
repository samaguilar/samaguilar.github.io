                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>The Critical Review is a course review aggregator that allows Brown University students to learn more about courses they might be interested in taking. A dedicated team of writers compile reviews submitted by students at the end of each semester, and upload the information and feedback to the website. After years without a proper update, our task was to develop a redesigned version of the website that made searching and uploading reviews both easier and friendlier.</p>

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>Even before developing the first batch of mockups, I first set out to find out how people were currently using the website and interacting with the information. Any insights as to how they consumed the information and what information they were specifically looking for would be crucial in determining the layout of the website. I interviewed a small group of students (about 7), who informed me that they found the old website both confusing and outdated. They described it as being “clunky”, “slow”, and “hard to navigate”. Another paint point came from the graphs and statistics associated with each course. From the interviews, I found that student’s were unsure how to interpret the demographic data and how the rating system worked. </p>

            <h1>The Design</h1>
            <p>The design of the website was ultimately shaped by the responses from the interviews, and my own analysis of parallel websites. The two that quickly came to mind were Rotten Tomatoes and Wikipedia. What do both of these sites have in common? Their core source of information is text based, and it’s their unique approaches to displaying it that formed the basis for Critical Review’s layout. Navigation and the search bar were naturally shifted towards the top, which would allow users to quickly find other courses from any page on the site. The review text and header were shifted left, freeing up space on the right that allows the statistics box to float as the user scrolls through a review. The graphs and statistics were also redesigned, allowing users to hover over them, revealing a quick breakdown of what the information means. The simplified home page truly emphasizes what the website is all about; finding the right information and being able to quickly discover all the courses Brown has to offer.</p>
